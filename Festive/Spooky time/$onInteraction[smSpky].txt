$title[__SPOOKY COINS__]
$description[** **
Spooky coins  ( üéÉ )  are the **Spooky Time's currency**. You can only use or get  üéÉ  while the event is active (admins can activate/deactivate events freely)

There are **two ways of getting** spooky coins: talking in the server and tricking someone

**__TALKING__**

You have **30% chances** of getting **10 spooky coins**  ( üéÉ )  when **sending messages** in the server (100 seconds cooldown)

TeriTeri will react with "üéÉ" to the messages that made you win coins

**__TRICKING SOMEONE__**

You, and the person you are trick or treating with, obtain a random number **between 50 and 200** üéÉ if "**trick**" is the chosen option

**__USING COINS__**

You can use your üéÉ to **buy sweets** in the spooky shop
