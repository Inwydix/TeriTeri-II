# 😊 TeriTeri II 🥒
TeriTeri II is a Theresa Apocalypse (Honkai Impact 3rd) Discord fan-bot. She was created using the Bot Designer For Discord (BDFD) app, which works with premade functions. This makes coding her easier, but also pretty inefficient and with limitations (like not being able to make loops or always needing a trigger for the commands)

She is a fun oriented bot, so most (if not all) of her commands were made for playing and have fun! 😄

# 📖 A little bit of her history 
> The very first version of this bot was made by The Zermiste for the TeriTeriCult server. It was a pretty basic bot with an economy system based on the Honkai Impact 3rd game

> The second version was made by both of us, The Zermiste and I. This was a big update that made her feel like a complete new bot. We added a whole gacha system and stigmas that gave boosts and benefits to who equipped them.

> On summer 2022, the TeriTeriCult server was nuked. We created a new one, but The Zermiste refused to come with us. Since then, I'm the one and only bot dev, who keeps the bot alive and updated.
> She has changed a lot since she is on my hands, and I will continue to evolve her into the beautiful 🦋 butterfly 🦋 she is destined to be
